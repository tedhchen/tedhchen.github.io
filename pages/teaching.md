##### Research Design for Environmental Social Science
**Description** This is a graduate-level course on research design for environmental social science. This course will introduce students to research design considerations and how they fit into the scientific method. The course is organized around hands-on learning, with the goal that by the end of the course, students will have produced a publication-level and implementable research design.

##### Politics of Climate Governance
**Description** This is an undergraduate-level course on the politics of climate change governance. Here, we will explore how climate mitigation and adaptation decisions are made and their consequences for different segments of society. In approaching these topics, we will emphasize taking a systems approach to understanding the policy process as a component of a complex socioecological system.

In this course, we will practice being informed consumers of social scientific research, with considerable course efforts put toward individual and team-based critiques and applications of research findings and methodology.

##### Environmental Social Science (Human Dimensions)
**Description** This is a undergraduate-level course on human-environment interactions with a focus on environmental governance and policy-making. In this course, we will look at how humans shape and are in turn shaped by the environment. In approaching this topic, we will emphasize taking a systems approach to understanding human-environment interactions as complex socioecological systems. The course is organized around hands-on learning, with considerable time and effort put toward individual and team-based production of policy and community engagement projects.
