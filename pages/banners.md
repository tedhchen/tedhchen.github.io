This photo was taken in Pugwash, Nova Scotia in the Summer of 2019 after I defended my dissertation, which included a chapter on the Pugwash movement. This is the site of [the first Pugwash Conference](https://pugwashconferences.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1957_pugwash_group.jpg "Group photo from the first Pugwash Conference.") which took place in July, 1957. I did abolutely no field work during this trip.
